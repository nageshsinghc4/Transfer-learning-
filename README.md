# Transfer Learning use cases

## What is Transfer Learning?
Transfer learning is a machine learning method where a model developed for a task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task.
Transfer Learning differs from traditional Machine Learning in that it is the use of pre-trained models that have been used for another task to jump start the development process on a new task or problem.

This repository contains various use cases where we apply transfer learning techniques to solve a particular business problem.

Refer [Keras Applications](https://keras.io/api/applications/) to know about all the available Transfer Learning techniques.
